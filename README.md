# LearnGL

A repository to store code as I go through the process of learning OpenGL, 
typically from LearnOpenGL.com with my own spin on a lot of the things.  
I would like to use this repository to build out a fleshed out (but still simple) 
renderer, with proper abstractions and modularity.  This code is definitely not
production-ready and is just a big learning project for me.
